# INTRODUCTION
## What is Deforestation ?
Deforestation is large_scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities

## The Global Impact ?
* loss of biodiversity.
* Damage to natural habitats.
* Disturbances in the water cycle.
* Soil Erosion.

## Forest loss and damage is the cause of around 10% of global warming.

## Observations & Recommendations
a. The World forest area has seen a **3.21%** decrease between 1990 and 2016, i.e. lost an area 
slightly larger than *Peru*. Where the highest decrease in forest percentage was seen in the 
Regions of *Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa with* a **4.87% and 1.88%**
decrease respectively. 

b. From our data, Countries like *Nigeria, Togo and Uganda* should be a major focus, especially 
Nigeria losing **61.8% (106,506 sqkm)** of forest area. This could be due to building 
infrastructure, however it would be beneficial to create awareness and learn from countries 
such as *China, United States and Iceland* who saw an increase in forest area.

c. Overall, there were about **85** countries with less than **25%** increase in forest area, thus we 
can also suggest awareness campaigns and means to combat deforestation in those 
locations, while we use countries like *Suriname, Micronesia, Fed. Sts & Gabon* which saw 
greater than **75%** increase as case studies to adopt the methods used to combat 
deforestation.
