# INTRODUCTION
## What is Deforestation ?
Deforestation is large_scale removal of trees from forests (or other lands) for the facilitation of human activities

## Brief
ForestQuery is on a mission to combat deforestation around the world and to raise awareness 
about this topic and its impact on the environment. The data analysis team at ForestQuery has 
obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and 
year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

## The Global Impact ?
* loss of biodiversity.
* Damage to natural habitats.
* Disturbances in the water cycle.
* Soil Erosion.

## Forest loss and damage is the cause of around 10% of global warming.

## Summary
The data analysis team has used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an 
effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from 
successes.

## Observations & Recommendations
a. The World forest area has seen a **3.21%** decrease between 1990 and 2016, i.e. lost an area 
slightly larger than *Peru*. Where the highest decrease in forest percentage was seen in the 
Regions of *Latin America & Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa with* a **4.87% and 1.88%**
decrease respectively. 

b. From our data, Countries like *Nigeria, Togo and Uganda* should be a major focus, especially 
Nigeria losing **61.8% (106,506 sqkm)** of forest area. This could be due to building 
infrastructure, however it would be beneficial to create awareness and learn from countries 
such as *China, United States and Iceland* who saw an increase in forest area.

c. Overall, there were about **85** countries with less than **25%** increase in forest area, thus we 
can also suggest awareness campaigns and means to combat deforestation in those 
locations, while we use countries like *Suriname, Micronesia, Fed. Sts & Gabon* which saw 
greater than **75%** increase as case studies to adopt the methods used to combat 
deforestation.
